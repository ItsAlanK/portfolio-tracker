# Portfolio Tracker #
The porfolio tracker is a tool created as a way for investors of stock and crypto to easily monitor their investments and plot changes to a spreadsheet.

In order to do this on a regular basis manually this requires searching prices and calculating the changes manually or logging in and bouncing between several investment apps in order to track individual assets as not all are supported in one location.

This idea comes from a personal desire for an app such as this as I currently plot my own profits/losses through a spreadsheet which I have had to create and maintain manually. This project will aid in automating some of the processes that I carry out daily.
